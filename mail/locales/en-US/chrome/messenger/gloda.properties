# LOCALIZATION NOTE (*.facetLabel): These are the labels used to label the facet
#  displays in the global search facet display mechanism.  Like thread pane
#  column headers these should be relatively short but can take advantage of
#  attributes with longer displays to be slightly longer.  For example, the
#  conversation attribute is larger than most attributes, so can have a slightly
#  longer label.  You can and should use the facetTooltip to provide a better
#  and longer explanation of what the facet attribute is.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (*.facetTooltip): These are the tooltips that will be
#  displayed if you hover over the facet's label.  These should be longer than
#  the facetLabel and reduce confusion about what the facet is, but do not
#  need to be a book on the subject.


# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.folder.*): Stores the message folder in
#  which the message is stored.
gloda.message.attr.folder.facetLabel=Mail Folder
gloda.message.attr.folder.facetTooltip=The folder where the message is stored.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.fromMe.*): Stores everyone involved
#  with the message.  This means from/to/cc/bcc.
gloda.message.attr.fromMe.facetLabel=From Me
gloda.message.attr.fromMe.facetTooltip=Messages where I was the author.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.toMe.*): Stores everyone involved
#  with the message.  This means from/to/cc/bcc.
gloda.message.attr.toMe.facetLabel=To Me
gloda.message.attr.toMe.facetTooltip=Messages where I was on the To or Cc lines.


# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.involves.*): Stores everyone involved
#  with the message.  This means from/to/cc/bcc.
gloda.message.attr.involves.facetLabel=People
gloda.message.attr.involves.facetTooltip=People explicitly involved in the message by being listed on the From, To, Cc, or Bcc lines.
gloda.message.attr.involves.includeLabel=Involving
gloda.message.attr.involves.excludeLabel=Not involving

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.date.*): Stores the date of the message.
#  Thunderbird normally stores the date the message claims it was composed
#  according to the "Date" header.  This is not the same as when the message
#  was sent or when it was eventually received by the user.  In the future we
#  may change this to be one of the other dates, but not anytime soon.
gloda.message.attr.date.facetLabel=Date
gloda.message.attr.date.facetTooltip=The date the message claims it was authored.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.attachmentTypes.*): Stores the list of
#  MIME types (ex: image/png, text/plain) of real attachments (not just part of
#  the message content but explicitly named attachments) on the message.
#  Although we hope to be able to provide localized human-readable explanations
#  of the MIME type (ex: "PowerPoint document"), I don't know if that is going
#  to happen.
gloda.message.attr.attachmentTypes.facetLabel=Attachments
gloda.message.attr.attachmentTypes.facetTooltip=The type of attachments found on the message, if any.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.mailing-list.*): Stores the mailing
#  lists detected in the message.  This will normally be the e-mail address of
#  the mailing list and only be detected in messages received from the mailing
#  list.  Extensions may contribute additional detected mailing-list-like
#  things.
gloda.message.attr.mailing-list.facetLabel=Mail List Involved
gloda.message.attr.mailing-list.facetTooltip=If the message was sent via a mailing list, the e-mail address associated with the mailing list.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.tag.*): Stores the tags applied to the
#  message.  Notably, gmail's labels are not currently exposed via IMAP and we
#  do not do anything clever with gmail, so this is indepdendent of gmail
#  labels.  This may change in the future, but it's a safe bet it's not
#  happening on Thunderbird's side prior to 3.0.
gloda.message.attr.tag.facetLabel=Tags
gloda.message.attr.tag.facetTooltip=Tags applied to the message.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.tag.*): Stores whether the message is
#  starred or not, as indicated by a pretty star icon.  In the past, the icon
#  used to be a flag.  The IMAP terminology continues to be "flagged".
gloda.message.attr.star.facetLabel=Starred
gloda.message.attr.star.facetTooltip=Is the message starred / flagged?

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.read.*): Stores whether the user has
#  read the message or not.
gloda.message.attr.read.facetLabel=Read
gloda.message.attr.read.facetTooltip=Is the message marked read, or is it unread?

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.repliedTo.*): Stores whether we believe
#  the user has ever replied to the message.  We normally show a little icon in
#  the thread pane when this is the case.
gloda.message.attr.repliedTo.facetLabel=Replied To
gloda.message.attr.repliedTo.facetTooltip=Has this message been replied to?

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.forwarded.*): Stores whether we believe
#  the user has ever forwarded the message.  We normally show a little icon in
#  the thread pane when this is the case.
gloda.message.attr.forwarded.facetLabel=Forwarded
gloda.message.attr.forwarded.facetTooltip=Has this message been forwarded to anyone?

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.*.label): Map categories of MIME
#  types defined in mimeTypeCategories.js to labels.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.archives.label): Archive is
#  referring to things like zip files, tar files, tar.gz files, etc.
gloda.mimetype.category.archives.label=Archives
gloda.mimetype.category.documents.label=Documents
gloda.mimetype.category.images.label=Images
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.media.label): Media is meant to
#  encompass both audio and video.  This is because video and audio streams are
#  frequently stored in the same type of container and we cannot rely on the
#  sending e-mail client to have been clever enough to figure out what was
#  really in the file.  So we group them together.
gloda.mimetype.category.media.label=Media (Audio, Video)
gloda.mimetype.category.pdf.label=PDF Files
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.other.label): Other is the category
#  for MIME types that we don't really know what it is.
gloda.mimetype.category.other.label=Other
