  <!-- Thunderbird's tab UI mechanism.
    -
    - We expect to be instantiated with the following children:
    - * One "tabpanels" child element whose id must be placed in the
    -   "panelcontainer" attribute on the element we are being bound to. We do
    -   this because it is important to allow overlays to contribute panels.
    -   When we attempted to have the immediate children of the bound element
    -   be propagated through use of the "children" tag, we found that children
    -   contributed by overlays did not propagate.
    - * Any children you want added to the right side of the tab bar.  This is
    -   primarily intended to allow for "open a BLANK tab" buttons, namely
    -   calendar and tasks.  For reasons similar to the tabpanels case, we
    -   expect the instantiating element to provide a child hbox for overlays
    -   to contribute buttons to.
    -
    - From a javascript perspective, there are three types of code that we
    -  expect to interact with:
    - 1) Code that wants to open new tabs.
    - 2) Code that wants to contribute one or more varieties of tabs.
    - 3) Code that wants to monitor to know when the active tab changes.
    -
    - Consumer code should use the following methods:
    - * openTab(aTabModeName, aArgs)
    -     Open a tab of the given "mode", passing the provided arguments as an
    -     object. The tab type author should tell you the modes they implement
    -     and the required/optional arguments.
    -
    -     Each tab type can define the set of arguments that it expects, but
    -     there are also a few common ones that all should obey, including:
    -
    -     * "background": if this is true, the tab will be loaded in the
    -       background.
    -     * "disregardOpener": if this is true, then the tab opener will not
    -       be switched to automatically by tabmail if the new tab is immediately
    -       closed.
    -
    - * closeTab(aOptionalTabIndexInfoOrTabNode,aNoUndo):
    -     If no argument is provided, the current tab is closed. The first
    -     argument specifies a specific tab to be closed. It can be a tab index,
    -     a tab info object, or a tab's DOM element. In case the second
    -     argument is true, the closed tab can't be restored by calling
    -     undoCloseTab().
    -     Please note, some tabs cannot be closed. Trying to close such tab,
    -     will fail silently.
    - * undoCloseTab():
    -     Restores the most recent tab closed by the user.
    - * switchToTab(aTabIndexInfoOrTabNode):
    -     Switch to the tab by providing a tab index, tab info object, or tab
    -     node (tabmail-tab bound element.) Instead of calling this method,
    -     you can also just poke at tabmail.tabContainer and its selectedIndex
    -     and selectedItem properties.
    - * setTabIcon(aTabNodeorInfo, aIcon): Sets the tab icon to the specified
    -     url or removes the icon if no url is specified. Note that this may
    -     override css-provided images.
    - * replaceTabWithWindow(aTab):
    -     Detaches a tab from this tabbar to new window. The argument "aTab" is
    -     required and can be a tab index, a tab info object or a tabs's
    -     DOM element. Calling this method works only for tabs implementing
    -     session restore.
    - * moveTabTo(aTab,aIndex):
    -     moves the given tab to the given Index. The first argument can be
    -     a tab index, a tab info object or a tab's DOM element. The second
    -     argument specifies the tabs new absolute position within the tabbar.
    -
    - Less-friendly consumer methods:
    - * persistTab(tab):
    -     serializes a tab into an object, by passing  a tab info object as
    -     argument. It is used for session restore and moving tabs between
    -     windows. Returns null in case persist fails.
    - * removeCurrentTab():
    -     Close the current tab.
    - * removeTabByNode(aTabElement):
    -     Close the tab whose tabmail-tab bound element is passed in.
    - Changing the currently displayed tab is accomplished by changing
    -  tabmail.tabContainer's selectedIndex or selectedItem property.
    -
    - Code that lives in a tab should use the following methods:
    - * setTabTitle([aOptionalTabInfo]): Tells us that the title of the current
    -   tab (if no argument is provided) or provided tab needs to be updated.
    -   This will result in a call to the tab mode's logic to update the title.
    -   In the event this is not for the current tab, the caller is responsible
    -   for ensuring that the underlying tab mode is capable of providing a tab
    -   title when it is in the background.  (The is currently not the case for
    -   "folder" and "mail" modes because of their implementation.)
    - * setTabBusy(aTabNode, aBusyState): Tells us that the tab in question
    -   is now busy or not busy.  "Busy" means that it is occupied and
    -   will not be able to respond to you until it is no longer busy.
    -   This impacts the cursor display, as well as potentially
    -   providing tab display hints.
    - * setTabThinking(aTabNode, aThinkingState): Tells us that the
    -   tab in question is now thinking or not thinking.  "Thinking" means
    -   that the tab is involved in some ongoing process but you can still
    -   interact with the tab while it is thinking.  A search would be an
    -   example of thinking.  This impacts spinny-thing feedback as well as
    -   potential providing tab display hints.  aThinkingState may be a
    -   boolean or a localized string explaining what you are thinking about.
    -
    - Tab contributing code should define a tab type object and register it
    -  with us by calling registerTabType. You can remove a registered tab
    -  type (eg when unloading a restartless addon) by calling unregisterTabType.
    -  Each tab type can provide multiple tab modes. The rationale behind this
    -  organization is that Thunderbird historically/currently uses a single
    -  3-pane view to display both three-pane folder browsing and single message
    -  browsing across multiple tabs. Each tab type has the ability to use a
    -  single tab panel for all of its display needs. So Thunderbird's "mail"
    -  tab type covers both the "folder" (3-pane folder-based browsing) and
    -  "message" (just a single message) tab modes. Likewise, calendar/lightning
    -  currently displays both its calendar and tasks in the same panel. A tab
    -  type can also create a new tabpanel for each tab as it is created. In
    -  that case, the tab type should probably only have a single mode unless
    -  there are a number of similar modes that can gain from code sharing.
    -
    - The tab type definition should include the following attributes:
    - * name: The name of the tab-type, mainly to aid in debugging.
    - * panelId or perTabPanel: If using a single tab panel, the id of the
    -     panel must be provided in panelId.  If using one tab panel per tab,
    -     perTabPanel should be either the XUL element name that should be
    -     created for each tab, or a helper function to create and return the
    -     element.
    - * modes: An object whose attributes are mode names (which are
    -     automatically propagated to a 'name' attribute for debugging) and
    -     values are objects with the following attributes...
    - * any of the openTab/closeTab/saveTabState/showTab/onTitleChanged
    -     functions as described on the mode definitions.  These will only be
    -     called if the mode does not provide the functions.  Note that because
    -     the 'this' variable passed to the functions will always reference the
    -     tab type definition (rather than the mode definition), the mode
    -     functions can defer to the tab type functions by calling
    -     this.functionName().  (This should prove convenient.)
    - Mode definition attributes:
    - * type: The "type" attribute to set on the displayed tab for CSS purposes.
    -     Generally, this would be the same as the mode name, but you can do as
    -     you please.
    - * isDefault: This should only be present and should be true for the tab
    -     mode that is the tab displayed automatically on startup.
    - * maxTabs: The maximum number of this mode that can be opened at a time.
    -     If this limit is reached, any additional calls to openTab for this
    -     mode will simply result in the first existing tab of this mode being
    -     displayed.
    - * shouldSwitchTo(aArgs): Optional function. Called when openTab is called
    -     on the top-level tabmail binding. It is used to decide if the openTab
    -     function should switch to an existing tab or actually open a new tab.
    -     If the openTab function should switch to an existing tab, return the
    -     index of that tab; otherwise return -1.
    -     aArgs is a set of named parameters (the ones that are later passed to
    -     openTab).
    - * openTab(aTab, aArgs): Called when a tab of the given mode is in the
    -     process of being opened.  aTab will have its "mode" attribute
    -     set to the mode definition of the tab mode being opened.  You should
    -     set the "title" attribute on it, and may set any other attributes
    -     you wish for your own use in subsequent functions.  Note that 'this'
    -     points to the tab type definition, not the mode definition as you
    -     might expect.  This allows you to place common logic code on the
    -     tab type for use by multiple modes and to defer to it.  Any arguments
    -     provided to the caller of tabmail.openTab will be passed to your
    -     function as well, including background.
    - * closeTab(aTab): Called when aTab is being closed.  The tab need not be
    -     currently displayed.  You are responsible for properly cleaning up
    -     any state you preserved in aTab.
    - * saveTabState(aTab): Called when aTab is being switched away from so that
    -     you can preserve its state on aTab.  This is primarily for single
    -     tab panel implementations; you may not have much state to save if your
    -     tab has its own tab panel.
    - * showTab(aTab): Called when aTab is being displayed and you should
    -     restore its state (if required).
    - * persistTab(aTab): Called when we want to persist the tab because we are
    -     saving the session state.  You should return an object suitable for
    -     JSON serialization.  The object will be provided to your restoreTab
    -     method when we attempt to restore the session.  If your code is
    -     unable or unwilling to persist the tab (some of the time), you should
    -     return null in that case.  If your code never wants to persist the tab
    -     you should not implement this method.  You must implement restoreTab
    -     if you implement this method.
    - * restoreTab(aTabmail, aPersistedState): Called when we are restoring a
    -     tab session and a tab with your mode was previously persisted via a
    -     call to your persistTab implementation.  You are provided with a
    -     reference to this tabmail instance and the (deserialized) state object
    -     you returned from your persistTab implementation.  It is your
    -     function's job to determine if you can restore the tab, and if so,
    -     you should invoke aTabmail.openTab to actually cause your tab to be
    -     opened.  This may seem odd, but it should help keep your code simple
    -     while letting you do whatever you want.  Since openTab is synchronous
    -     and returns the tabInfo structure built for the tab, you can perform
    -     any additional work you need after the call to openTab.
    - * onTitleChanged(aTab): Called when someone calls tabmail.setTabTitle() to
    -     hint that the tab's title needs to be updated.  This function should
    -     update aTab.title if it can.
    - Mode definition functions to do with menu/toolbar commands:
    - * supportsCommand(aCommand, aTab): Called when a menu or toolbar needs to
    -     be updated. Return true if you support that command in
    -     isCommandEnabled and doCommand, return false otherwise.
    - * isCommandEnabled(aCommand, aTab): Called when a menu or toolbar needs
    -     to be updated. Return true if the command can be executed at the
    -     current time, false otherwise.
    - * doCommand(aCommand, aTab): Called when a menu or toolbar command is to
    -     be executed. Perform the action appropriate to the command.
    - * onEvent(aEvent, aTab): This can be used to handle different events on
    -     the window.
    - * getBrowser(aTab): This function should return the browser element for
    -     your tab if there is one (return null or don't define this function
    -     otherwise). It is used for some toolkit functions that require a
    -     global "getBrowser" function, e.g. ZoomManager.
    -
    - Tab monitoring code is expected to be used for widgets on the screen
    -  outside of the tab box that need to update themselves as the active tab
    -  changes.
    - Tab monitoring code (un)registers itself via (un)registerTabMonitor.
    -  The following attributes should be provided on the monitor object:
    - * monitorName: A string value naming the tab monitor/extension.  This is
    -     the canonical name for the tab monitor for all persistence purposes.
    -     If the tab monitor wants to store data in the tab info object and its
    -     name is FOO it should store it in 'tabInfo._ext.FOO'.  This is the
    -     only place the tab monitor should store information on the tab info
    -     object.  The FOO attribute will not be automatically created; it is
    -     up to the code.  The _ext attribute will be there, reliably, however.
    -     The name is also used when persisting state, but the tab monitor
    -     does not need to do anything in that case; the name is automatically
    -     used in the course of wrapping the object.
    -  The following functions should be provided on the monitor object:
    - * onTabTitleChanged(aTab): Called when the tab's title changes.
    - * onTabSwitched(aTab, aOldTab): Called when a new tab is made active.  If
    -     this is the first tab ever, aOldTab will be null, otherwise aOldTab
    -     will be the previously active tab.
    - * onTabOpened(aTab, aIsFirstTab, aWasCurrentTab): Called when a new tab is
    -     opened.  This method is invoked after the tab mode's openTab method
    -     is invoked.  This method is invoked before the tab monitor
    -     onTabSwitched method in the case where it will be invoked.  (It is
    -     not invoked if the tab is opened in the background.)
    - * onTabClosing(aTab): Called when a tab is being closed.  This method is
    -     is invoked before the call to the tab mode's closeTab function.
    - * onTabPersist(aTab): Return a JSON-representable object to persist for
    -     the tab.  Return null if you do not have anything to persist.
    - * onTabRestored(aTab, aState, aIsFirstTab): Called when a tab is being
    -     restored and there is data previously persisted by the tab monitor.
    -     This method is called instead of invoking onTabOpened.  This is done
    -     because the restoreTab method (potentially) uses the tabmail openTab
    -     API to effect restoration.  (Note: the first opened tab is special;
    -     it will produce an onTabOpened notification potentially followed by
    -     an onTabRestored notification.)
    - Tab monitor code is also allowed to hook into the command processing
    -  logic.  We support the standard supportsCommand/isCommandEnabled/
    -  doCommand functions but with a twist to indicate when other tab monitors
    -  and the actual tab itself should get a chance to process: supportsCommand
    -  and isCommandEnabled should return null when they are not handling the
    -  case.  doCommand should return true if it handled the case, null
    -  otherwise.
