SharedMenusCocoa provides menu sharing for integration with URL Manager Pro.
It is available under an MIT license.  The contents of this directory,
excluding this README, come from the source of the SharedMenusCocoa framework:

ftp://ftp.url-manager.com/pub/SharedMenusCocoa.dmg.bin

The source was downloaded on 2008-01-24, at which time SharedMenusCocoa.dmg.bin
had a modification date of 2003-01-23.  Everything included from that disk
image is included here, except:
 - The "build" directory has been omitted.  In the disk image, the "build"
   directory contained a prebuilt framework for PowerPC.
 - The Project Builder-based SharedMenusCocoa.pbproj project has been
   upgraded to an Xcode-based SharedMenusCocoa.xcodeproj project.  This was
   done to allow the use of a native Xcode target, for which Xcode provides
   superior support.  Within the project:
    + The legacy jam-based SharedMenusCocoa target has been upgraded
      to an Xcode-based native framework target.  The legacy target has
      been removed and the upgraded target has been renamed appropriately.
      The accompanying Info.plist generated by the upgrade process is also
      included, renamed from the ugly name given by the upgrade process.  It
      is placed in the Resouces source group in the project.
    + The unnecessary Default build configuration created by the upgrade has
      been removed.
    + The empty Build Resource Manager Resources phase has been deleted.
    + The following build settings were deleted, as the defaults are suitable:
      OTHER_LDFLAGS SECTORDER_FLAGS ZERO_LINK FRAMEWORK_VERSION
      WRAPPER_EXTENSION FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS
      LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS GCC_DYNAMIC_NO_PIC
      GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN OTHER_CFLAGS
    + In the Deployment target, the setting for GCC_ENABLE_FIX_AND_CONTINUE
      has been deleted, as the default is suitable.
    + INFOPLIST_FILE has been set properly.
    + PREBINDING has been turned off, as it is no longer desirable.
