Sparkle is an MIT-like-licensed framework used for Camino's auto-update
functionality. See http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/ for more information about
Sparkle. The Sparkle framework is shipped inside Camino's bundle, and some glue
code is included in Camino itself.

This is based on trunk r52 of Sparkle:
svn co -r52 http://code.andymatuschak.org/sparkle/trunk Sparkle
with the following changes:
- Bug 405901: fix an XML attribute handling bug (already part of Sparkle trunk)
- Bug 412857: don't show CFBundleVersion (Sparkle ticket 150; may require some
  change on our part when we switch to trunk)
- Bug 412837: keep updates out of the quarantine
- In support of bug 413709: let an empty value for SUFeedURLKey disable updates
- Bug 426001: fix build error with 10.5 SDK in SUUnarchiver.m (already part of
  Sparkle trunk)
