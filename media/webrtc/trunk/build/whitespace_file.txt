Let's make a story. Add one sentence for each commit:

It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents--except at
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along
the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that
struggled against the darkness. A dark figure emerged.

It was a Domo-Kun. "What took you so long?", inquired his wife.
Silence. Not noticing his silence, she continued, "Did Mr. Usagi enjoy the
waffles you brought him?"
